  <p>The Idea of this came when a friend at work had his house broke into and had items taken,
  of those items a PS4 was involved. He tried to find it but had no luck, then I thought of making a bot
  like thing to search the web for his PS4. It was a long shot and then another friend at work suggested I make 
  something like this, and so I did and here it is.</p>

   <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <p>This is very simple. You just Register your item(s) so you will add as much detail and description as you can upload a picture
  give what ever information you want to give for contacting you if someone ever finds your stuff and give your name and then hit submit.Then you
  can go to (Profile) and edit, update, and flag your item(s) missing and or found which would just be unflaging your item.</p>
